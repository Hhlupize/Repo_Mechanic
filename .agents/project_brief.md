# Repo Mechanic â€” Local Agentic Code Fixer (MVP)
Goal: A CLI that reads a small Python repo, plans fixes for failing tests/lints,
applies minimal patches with guardrails, re-runs checks, and writes human-readable receipts.
Stack: Python 3.11+, Typer CLI, pytest, ruff, black, uv (or poetry). No cloud needed.
