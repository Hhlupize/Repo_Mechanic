# Task 005 â€” UX & Docs
- Typer help texts; README Quickstart + architecture diagram (ASCII ok).
- scripts/demo.sh to run a full demo end-to-end.
- .github/workflows/ci.yml to lint and run tests on push.
Acceptance: `bash scripts/demo.sh` finishes with receipts/*/summary.md and green tests for fixture.
